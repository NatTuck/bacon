 * Implement a type system. In addition to allowing polymorphic functions, this would also
   let Bacon C ignore the Nvidia compiler's lame implmeentation of overloaded functions.
   This is basically just an issue of propagating type information through expressions.
   Can detect (and evaluate, if that matters) constant expressions.
