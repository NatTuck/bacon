== Errors.bc ==

Demonstrate the use of the debugging statements provided in Bacon C:

 * fail("Message", error_data)
 * assert(boolean_condition, "Message", error_data)

'fail' will abort the running OpenCL kernel and throw a C++ exception. The error_data,
a signed cl_long value, will be available to the user.

'assert' is similar, but it only aborts if the boolean_condition is false.
