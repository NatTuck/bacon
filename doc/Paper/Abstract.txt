This paper describes Bacon, a data-parallel programming language
targetting OpenCL-compatible graphics processors. Bacon is an
extension of the existing OpenCL C language intended to make it easier
for programmers to write high performance kernels for GPU accelerated
applications. 

The design and implementation are described and
benchmarks are provided showing performance improvements over a
similar simple OpenCL C kernel.

Bacon, like OpenCL C, is based on C99 with
